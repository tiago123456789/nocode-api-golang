## 🚀 ABOUT

This project is designed to help you create an API as quickly as possible—without writing a backend!  
Simply define your endpoints based on your PostgreSQL tables, and you're good to go.

## 🛠 TECHNOLOGIES

Powered by a modern tech stack for speed and scalability:

- **Go** (v1.24)
- **Fiber** (Lightning-fast web framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (Database)
- **Redis** (Cache)
- **Github actions** (To run unit tests)
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (Effortless containerized deployment)

## ⚡ HOW TO RUN LOCALLY

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Create a `.env` file** based on `.env.example`
3. **Run the following command:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 📌 ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Architecture

![Architecture](./archeticture.png "Architecture")

#### About the architecture

- The project can scale horizontally without problem.
- The good place to run the project is the GCP cloud run, because will scale the api for automatically, serverless container solution where you pay only for executions and all the logs from all instances from api will be centralized at one place.
